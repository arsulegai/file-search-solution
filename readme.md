# File Search Application

The application connects to the cloud storage and
searches through the files in the directory that is
configured. A query can be passed to get the matching
files.

## Requirements

Functional and non-functional requirements are captured
in the [requirements](docs/requirements/requirements.md) section.

A high level PRD/ERD task list is available at
[PRD / ERD](docs/requirements/prd-erd.md) section.

## Design

The design follows a modular, scalable approach.
However, the current demo and the minimum viable product
assumes certain components are not built.

Check the design considerations and assumptions in the
[High Level Design](./docs/design/hld.md) document.
